        Waylens, Inc. provides a new intelligent camera system designed to amplify your fun behind the wheel with its
        high-performance camera, stylish steering wheel-mounted remote, and a wireless adaptor that connects to a
        vehicle’s computer. The Waylens system records and overlays real-time performance data over stunning HD video
        to capture every aspect of your drive. The system includes an innovative mobile app, cloud server and
        automated smart editing software that uses algorithms to pick out the best "Moments" from your hours of
        aggregated driving footage.
      </p> <p data-v-59b2bf21="">
        In providing these valuable services, Waylens collects information about you, your car and driving habits.
        Waylens understands that privacy is important to you so we are providing a plain English summary of each
        section of the Privacy Policy below. This Privacy Policy explains the details of how we collect, use, share
        and protect the information we collect from you. The words that are capitalized are defined at the end of
        this Policy.
      </p> <p data-v-59b2bf21="">
        This policy only applies to us and to our Agents. We cannot control what other Waylens Users do with any
        information you share on or through Waylens. Be careful with your own information and what you are willing to
        share.
      </p> <p data-v-59b2bf21="">

          non-browser-based interaction between you and Waylens.
        </li></ul> <p data-v-59b2bf21="">
        Please read this policy carefully to understand our policies and practices regarding your information and how
        we will treat it. If you do not agree with our policies and practices, your choice is not to use Waylens. By
        accessing or using Waylens, you agree to this Privacy Policy.
      </p> <p data-v-59b2bf21="">
        Waylens reserves the right to revise and update this policy from time to time. All changes are effective
        immediately when we post them and apply to all access to and use of Waylens thereafter. If you are a
        Registered User, we will usually notify you of any changes via email and/or by asking you to review the
        changes to this Privacy Policy or our Terms of Service the next time you login to Waylens. Your continued use
        of Waylens after the time the changes are communicated will indicate your acceptance of those revised changes,
        so please check the policy periodically for updates.

          If you choose to find your friends through a (ii) third-party social media site, then you will be prompted

          provide to us will be governed by this Privacy Policy.

        We may de-identify personal information, including information about your driving habits, that we have
        collected from you through the site, app or Camera and combine it with de-identified information about other
        Users, information from third parties, and/or publicly available information.
      </p> <h5 data-v-59b2bf21="">Information You Share with the Public Through Waylens Services</h5> <p data-v-59b2bf21="">
        Information posted through Waylens Services is, by default, published and shared with the public. That
        includes anything you choose to publish, post on, or submit to Waylens. Because this kind of information can
        be seen by anyone and can be indexed by search engines, you should exercise care in what you choose to submit;
        make sure everything you submit is something you want to share with everyone. To change your privacy settings
        on the Service, please change your profile setting. Once you have shared User Content or made it public, that
        User Content may be re-shared by others.
      </p> <p data-v-59b2bf21="">
        If you remove information that you posted to the Service, copies may remain viewable in cached and archived
        pages of the Service, or if other Users or third parties using the Waylens API have copied or saved that
        information.
      </p> <h5 data-v-59b2bf21="">Information You Share with Third Party Services</h5> <p data-v-59b2bf21="">
        Our content platform enables you to access third party services through Waylens Services. For example, Users
        can embed externally-pointing links in their content; Users can click on those links to reach other sites and
        services. We also enable Users to share information that you provide to us, like posts and comments, with
        other services. For example, Users may share your posts on Twitter and Facebook.
      </p> <p data-v-59b2bf21="">
        This Privacy Policy only covers information we collect. It does not cover information collected by other
        services. If you access third party services through Waylens Services, you are responsible for reading and
        understanding those other services' privacy policies.
      </p> <h5 data-v-59b2bf21="">Information We Share with Our Agents and Third Parties</h5> <ul data-v-59b2bf21=""><li data-v-59b2bf21="">
          We may share User Content and your information (including but not limited to, information from cookies, log
          files, device identifiers, location data, and usage data) with businesses that are legally part of the same
          group of companies that Waylens is part of, or that become part of that group ("Affiliates"). Affiliates may
          use this information to help provide, understand, and improve the Service (including by providing analytics)
          and Affiliates' own services (including by providing you with better and more relevant experiences). But
          these Affiliates will honor the choices you make about who can see your User Content.
        </li> <li data-v-59b2bf21="">
          We also may share your information as well as information from tools like cookies, log files, and device
          identifiers and location data, with third-party organizations that help us provide the Service to you
          ("Agents"). Our Agents will be given access to your information as is reasonably necessary to provide the
          Service under reasonable confidentiality terms.
        </li> <li data-v-59b2bf21="">
          We may also share certain information such as cookie data with third-party advertising partners. This
          information would allow third-party ad networks to, among other things, deliver targeted advertisements that
          they believe will be of most interest to you.
        </li> <li data-v-59b2bf21="">
          We may remove parts of data that can identify you and share anonymized data with other parties. We may also
          combine your information with other information in a way that it is no longer associated with you and share
          that aggregated information.
        </li></ul> <h5 data-v-59b2bf21="">Account Information</h5> <p data-v-59b2bf21="">
        When you create an account on Waylens, you either fill out forms with requested information on the Waylens
        site or you authenticate yourself through a third-party service, like Facebook. When you authenticate through
        another site, you link that account with your Waylens account. Once the accounts are linked, we may collect
        and store personally identifying information that you have provided to that third party service, and consented
        to having shared with services like us. Also, we store the email address that you provided to create your
        Waylens Account and any information you fill out on the Waylens site. We do not receive or store passwords for
        linked accounts.
      </p> <p data-v-59b2bf21="">
        When you link your Waylens account with a third party service account, we will get information about you from
        that third party service. That information could include, for example, biographical information or your
        geographic location, if you have provided that information to the third party service and made it available
        for Waylens to access. To the extent we obtain such information, we may store and use the information about
        you that we receive from third party services to improve and personalize Waylens Services. As a general
        practice, we strongly urge you to make careful judgments about any personal information you disclose to
        Internet services, including Waylens and any third party services you link to us.
      </p> <h5 data-v-59b2bf21="">Email Communications with Us</h5> <p data-v-59b2bf21="">
        If you contact us, we may keep a record of that correspondence. We may also ask you to complete surveys that
        we use for research purposes, although you do not have to respond to them. We may also keep details of your
        visits to our site including, but not limited to, traffic data, location data, weblogs and other communication
        data, and the resources that you access.
      </p> <p data-v-59b2bf21="">
        Occasionally, we might need to email you. We might need to send you some administrative information, tell you
        something important about your account or changes to our services, or update you on new policies. These
        administrative communications are considered part of Waylens Services and your Waylens account, which you may
        not be able to opt-out from receiving. Note that we will never email you to ask for your password or other
        Account information; if you receive such an email, contact us so we investigate and take any appropriate
        action.
      </p> <h5 data-v-59b2bf21="">Camera Diagnostic Information</h5> <p data-v-59b2bf21="">
        When you connect your Waylens camera to the Internet, we may automatically receive certain information about
        your camera and your use of the camera, including log files, camera modes, settings, durations, error rates,
        and other usage information. We collect and use this information solely in anonymous and aggregate form,
        unless you have provided your consent to associate this information with your camera serial number. This
        information helps us to improve our products and services, troubleshoot bugs, and analyze camera errors.
      </p> <h5 data-v-59b2bf21="">Mobile Software Applications</h5> <p data-v-59b2bf21="">
        When you use a Waylens mobile application we may automatically receive certain information about your mobile
        device and use of the application, including a device identifier, operating system, version, and other
        information about your mobile device as well as time spent in different portions of the Waylens mobile
        application. We monitor customer software usage to help us develop the design and layout of the mobile
        application and to improve the content to better match the interests of our Users. We may also collect
        different types of information about your location, including general information (e.g., IP address, zip code)
        and more specific information (e.g., GPS-based functionality on mobile devices used to access the Services),
        and may use that information to customize the Services. If you access the Services through a mobile device and
        you do not want your device to provide us with location-tracking information, you can disable the GPS or other
        location-tracking functions on your device, provided your device allows you to do this. See your device
        manufacturer’s instructions for further details.
      </p> <h5 data-v-59b2bf21="">Information Related to Your Web Browser</h5> <p data-v-59b2bf21="">
        We automatically receive and record information from your web browser when you interact with Waylens Services.
        This information may include your browser type and version, what sort of device you are using, your operating
        system and version, your language preference, the website or service that referred you to Waylens Services,
        the date and time of each web request you make, your screen display information, and information from any
        cookies we have placed on your web browser.
      </p> <h5 data-v-59b2bf21="">IP Address Information</h5> <p data-v-59b2bf21="">
        We may collect information about your computer, including where available your IP address, operating system
        and browser type, for system administration, to fight spam, malware and identity theft, and to report
        aggregate information to our advertisers, if any. We also may use it to personalize Waylens Services for you
        and to generate aggregate, non-identifying information about how people use Waylens Services.
      </p> <h5 data-v-59b2bf21="">Information Collected Using Cookies</h5> <p data-v-59b2bf21="">
        Like many websites, we use "cookie" technology to collect additional website usage data and to provide you
        with a good experience when you browse Waylens. This also allows us to improve our site.
      </p> <p data-v-59b2bf21="">
        A cookie is a small data file that is transferred to your computer's hard disk. Waylens may use both session
        cookies and persistent cookies to better understand how you interact with our Services, to monitor aggregate
        usage by our Users and web traffic routing on our Services, and to customize and improve our Services. Our
        cookies do not, by themselves, contain information that personally identifies you. Most Internet browsers
        automatically accept cookies. You can instruct your browser, by changing its settings, to stop accepting
        cookies or to prompt you before accepting a cookie from the websites you visit. However, if you use your
        browser settings to block all cookies (including essential cookies) you may not be able to access all or parts
        of Waylens. Unless you have adjusted your browser setting so that it will refuse cookies, our system will
        issue cookies as soon you visit Waylens.
      </p> <h5 data-v-59b2bf21="">Information About Your Contacts</h5> <p data-v-59b2bf21="">
        When you create your Waylens account, and authenticate via a third party service like Twitter, Waylens
        Services may collect, store, and periodically update the contact lists associated with that linked account, so
        that, for example, we can make it easy for you to connect with your existing contacts from that service who
        are also on Waylens.
      </p> <h5 data-v-59b2bf21="">Email Tracking</h5> <p data-v-59b2bf21="">
        To measure the deliverability of our emails to Users, we may embed information, such as a web beacon or tag,
        in them.
      </p> <p data-v-59b2bf21="">We never share information we receive from you unless:</p> <ul data-v-59b2bf21=""><li data-v-59b2bf21="">(a) we have your permission to share that information; or</li> <li data-v-59b2bf21="">(b) we have given you prior notice that the information will be shared, and with whom; or</li> <li data-v-59b2bf21="">(c) that information is aggregate information or other information that does not identify you.</li></ul> <h5 data-v-59b2bf21="">Information Disclosed Pursuant to Business Transfers</h5> <p data-v-59b2bf21="">
        We may buy or sell business assets. In these transactions, User information is typically one of the
        transferred business assets. Likewise, if we, or substantially all of our assets, get acquired, or if we go
        out of business or enter bankruptcy, User information would be one of the assets that is transferred or
        acquired by a third party. You acknowledge that such transfers may occur, and that any acquirer of us or our
        assets may continue to use your personal information as set forth in this policy.
      </p> <h5 data-v-59b2bf21="">Information Disclosed for Our Protection and the Protection of Others</h5> <p data-v-59b2bf21="">
        We try to protect you from having your privacy violated through abuse of the legal system, whether attempted
        by individuals, entities, or governments. It is our policy to insist upon jurisdiction and proper legal
        process for governmental information requests, and to contest claims we believe to be unwarranted by the law.
        At the same time, we also reserve the right to access, preserve, and disclose information as we reasonably
        believe is necessary, in our sole discretion, to (i) satisfy a valid law, regulation, legal process,
        governmental request, or governmental order, (ii) enforce this Privacy Policy and our Terms of Service,
        including investigation of potential violations hereof, (iii) detect, prevent, or otherwise address fraud,
        security or technical issues, including exchanging information with other companies and organizations for
        fraud protection and the prevention of spam and malware, (iv) respond to User support requests, or (v) protect
        the rights, property, health or safety of us, our Users, any third parties or the public in general.
      </p> <h5 data-v-59b2bf21="">Information We Share with Your Consent or at Your Request</h5> <p data-v-59b2bf21="">If you ask us to release information that we have about your account, we will do so if reasonable and not
        unduly
        burdensome.</p> <h5 data-v-59b2bf21="">Our Policy Towards Children</h5> <p data-v-59b2bf21="">
        Waylens is not intended for children under 13 years of age. No one under 13 years of age may provide any
        personal information to or on Waylens. We do not knowingly collect personal information from children under

        without your consent, please contact us at <a data-v-59b2bf21="" href="mailto:privacy@waylens.com">privacy@waylens.com</a>. We do
        not knowingly collect personal information from children under 13. If we become aware that a child under 13
        has provided us with personal information without verification of parental consent, we will take steps to
        remove such information and terminate the child's account.

          use that may differ from U.S. law, please note that we may transfer information, including personal
          information, to a country and jurisdiction that does not have the same data protection laws as your
          jurisdiction.
        </li> <li data-v-59b2bf21="">
          By registering for and using the Service you consent to the transfer of information to the U.S. or to any
          other country in which Waylens, its Affiliates or Agents maintain facilities and the use and disclosure of
          information about you as described in this Privacy Policy.
        </li> <li data-v-59b2bf21="">
          We use commercially reasonable safeguards to help keep the information collected through the Service secure
          and take reasonable steps (such as requesting a unique password) to verify your identity before granting you
          access to your account. However, Waylens cannot ensure the security of any information you transmit to
          Waylens or guarantee that information on the Service may not be accessed, disclosed, altered, or destroyed.
        </li> <li data-v-59b2bf21="">
          Please do your part to help us. You are responsible for maintaining the secrecy of your unique password and
          account information, and for controlling access to emails between you and Waylens, at all times. Your
          privacy settings may also be affected by changes the social media services you connect to Waylens make to
          their services. We are not responsible for the functionality, privacy, or security measures of any other
          organization.
        </li></ul> <h5 data-v-59b2bf21="">The Security of Your Information</h5> <p data-v-59b2bf21="">
        We have implemented measures designed to secure your personal information from accidental loss and from
        unauthorized access, use, alteration and disclosure. All information you provide to us is stored on our secure
        servers behind firewalls. We cannot, however, guarantee the security of any information. Unauthorized entry or
        use, hardware or software failure, and other factors may compromise the security of User information at any
        time. It’s important for you to prevent unauthorized access to your account and personal information by
        choosing and protecting a strong third party service password and by limiting access to your computer and
        browser by signing off after you have finished using Waylens Services.
      </p> <h5 data-v-59b2bf21="">Modifying Your Personal Information</h5> <p data-v-59b2bf21="">
        If you are a Registered User of Waylens, we provide you with tools and account settings to access or modify
        the personal information you provided to us and associated with your account.
      </p> <p data-v-59b2bf21="">
        You can review and change your personal information by logging into Waylens and visiting your account settings
        page. You may also send us an e-mail at <a data-v-59b2bf21="" href="mailto:admin@waylens.com">admin@waylens.com </a> to request
        access to, correct or delete any personal information that you have provided to us. We cannot delete your
        personal information except by also deleting your User account. We may not accommodate a request to change
        information if we believe the change would violate any law or legal requirement or cause the information to be
        incorrect.
      </p> <p data-v-59b2bf21="">
        If you delete your User Content from Waylens, copies of your User Content may remain viewable in cached and
        archived pages, or might have been copied or stored by other Website Users.
      </p> <h5 data-v-59b2bf21="">How to Delete Your Account and What Happens When You Delete Your Account</h5> <p data-v-59b2bf21="">
        If you want to delete your Account, we will enable you to do this in your account settings page. This is
        currently under development and will be available soon.. Deleting your Account will not entirely remove the
        content you have published from our systems, because of caching, backups, or other references to your account.
        In addition, given the sharing, commenting, and dialogue that takes place on Waylens Services, some of the
        public activity on your account prior to deletion may remain stored on our servers and accessible to the
        public indefinitely.

      <div class="title"> <h2>Waylens Privacy Policy</h2></div>
      <p>Waylens, Inc. provides a new intelligent camera system designed to amplify your fun behind the wheel with its
        high-performance camera, stylish steering wheel-mounted remote, and a wireless adaptor that connects to a
        vehicle’s computer. The Waylens system records and overlays real-time performance data over stunning HD video to
        capture every aspect of your drive. The system includes an innovative mobile app, cloud server and automated
        smart
        editing software that uses algorithms to pick out the best "Moments" from your hours of aggregated driving
        footage.</p>
      <p>In providing these valuable services, Waylens collects information about you, your car and driving habits.
        Waylens understands that privacy is important to you so we are providing a plain English summary of each section
        of the Privacy Policy below. This Privacy Policy explains the details of how we collect, use, share and protect
        the information we collect from you. The words that are capitalized are defined at the end of this <privacy></privacy>
        Policy.</p>
      <p>This policy only applies to us and to our Agents. We cannot control what other Waylens Users do with any
        information you share on or through Waylens. Be careful with your own information and what you are willing to
        share.</p>
      <p>This policy applies to information we collect:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>On Waylens website</li>
        <li>On the Waylens camera when connected to the Internet wireless or through your computer</li>
        <li>In e-mail, text and other electronic messages between you and Waylens.</li>
        <li>Through mobile and desktop applications you download from this Website, which provide dedicated
          non-browser-based interaction between you and Waylens.
        </li>
      </ul>
      <p>Please read this policy carefully to understand our policies and practices regarding your information and how
        we
        will treat it. If you do not agree with our policies and practices, your choice is not to use Waylens. By
        accessing or using Waylens, you agree to this Privacy Policy.</p>
      <p>Waylens reserves the right to revise and update this policy from time to time. All changes are effective
        immediately when we post them and apply to all access to and use of Waylens thereafter. If you are a Registered
        User, we will usually notify you of any changes via email and/or by asking you to review the changes to this
        Privacy Policy or our Terms of Service the next time you login to Waylens. Your continued use of Waylens after
        the
        time the changes are communicated will indicate your acceptance of those revised changes, so please check the
        policy periodically for updates.</p>
      <h4>Information We Collect On You</h4>
      <h5>Finding your friends on Waylens:</h5>
      <ul>
        <li>If you choose, you can use our "Find friends" feature to locate other people with Waylens accounts either
          through (i) your contacts list, (ii) third-party social media sites or (iii) through a search of names and
          Usernames on Waylens.
        </li>
        <li>If you choose to find your friends through (i) your device's contacts list, then Waylens will access your
          contacts list to determine whether or not someone associated with your contact is using Waylens.
        </li>
        <li>If you choose to find your friends through a (ii) third-party social media site, then you will be prompted
          to
          set up a link to the third-party service and you understand that any information that such service may provide
          to us will be governed by this Privacy Policy.
        </li>
        <li>If you choose to find your friends (iii) through a search of names or Usernames on Waylens then simply type
          a
          name to search and we will perform a search on our Service.
        </li>
      </ul>
      <h5>Note about "Invite Friends" feature:</h5> <p>If you choose to invite someone to the Service through
      our
      "Invite friends" feature, you may select a person directly from the contacts list on your device and send a text
      or email from your personal account. You understand and agree that you are responsible for any charges that
      apply
      to communications sent from your device, and because this invitation is coming directly from your personal
      account, Waylens does not have access to or control this communication.</p>
      <h5>Information You Submit</h5>
      <p>You may choose to provide us with personal information through the Services, like:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Contact information, such as your name, address, telephone number and email address.</li>
        <li>Information obtained from the Facebook account you use to login to the app or to log in to Waylens support
          on
          the site, such as your public profile (name, profile picture, age range, gender, language, country and other
          public information), friend list, email address, and relationships. (Your Facebook password is collected
          directly by Facebook without passing through our systems, and we do not have access to it.)
        </li>
        <li>Vehicle information, including the first nine digits of your VIN number which provides your vehicle make,
          model, and year.
        </li>
        <li>Personal information in communications and other content you submit or share, such as photographs and video
          clips.
        </li>
        <li>Contact information for friends on Facebook or other social networks, or contacts on the phone, for the
          purposes of inviting them to Waylens, or into a Waylens group for location-sharing.
        </li>
        <li>Information We Collect by Automated Means With the App</li>
      </ul>
      <p>If you use the app, we may collect the following information by automated means:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>The geo-location of your mobile device over time, and information that may be inferred from it, such as your
          driving speed at a particular time.
        </li>
        <li>The type of device you use and its operating system.</li>
        <li>Identification details of your device (e.g., unique device identifier).</li>
        <li>IP address.</li>
        <li>Information about your use of the app.</li>
      </ul>
      <h5>Information We Collect by Automated Means With the Camera</h5>
      <p>We may collect details about your vehicle’s use, operation, and performance, such as</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Speed</li>
        <li>Braking and acceleration metrics</li>
        <li>Engine start/stop and idle times</li>
        <li>The geo-location of the Camera</li>
      </ul>
      <h5>De-Identified and Non-Personally Identifiable Information</h5>
      <p>We may de-identify personal information, including information about your driving habits, that we have
        collected
        from you through the site, app or Camera and combine it with de-identified information about other Users,
        information from third parties, and/or publicly available information.</p>

      <h4>Information You Share with the Public Through Waylens Services</h4>
      <p>Information posted through Waylens Services is, by default, published and shared with the public. That includes
        anything you choose to publish, post on, or submit to Waylens. Because this kind of information can be seen by
        anyone and can be indexed by search engines, you should exercise care in what you choose to submit; make sure
        everything you submit is something you want to share with everyone. To change your privacy settings on the
        Service, please change your profile setting. Once you have shared User Content or made it public, that User
        Content may be re-shared by others.</p>
      <p>If you remove information that you posted to the Service, copies may remain viewable in cached and archived
        pages
        of the Service, or if other Users or third parties using the Waylens API have copied or saved that
        information.</p>

      <h4>Information You Share with Third Party Services</h4>
      <p>Our content platform enables you to access third party services through Waylens Services. For example, Users
        can
        embed externally-pointing links in their content; Users can click on those links to reach other sites and
        services. We also enable Users to share information that you provide to us, like posts and comments, with other
        services. For example, Users may share your posts on Twitter and Facebook.</p>
      <p>This Privacy Policy only covers information we collect. It does not cover information collected by other
        services. If you access third party services through Waylens Services, you are responsible for reading and
        understanding those other services' privacy policies.</p>
      <h4>Information We Share with Our Agents and Third Parties</h4>
      <ul>
        <li>We may share User Content and your information (including but not limited to, information from cookies, log
          files, device identifiers, location data, and usage data) with businesses that are legally part of the same
          group of companies that Waylens is part of, or that become part of that group ("Affiliates"). Affiliates may
          use
          this information to help provide, understand, and improve the Service (including by providing analytics) and
          Affiliates' own services (including by providing you with better and more relevant experiences). But these
          Affiliates will honor the choices you make about who can see your User Content.
        </li>
        <li>We also may share your information as well as information from tools like cookies, log files, and device
          identifiers and location data, with third-party organizations that help us provide the Service to you
          ("Agents"). Our Agents will be given access to your information as is reasonably necessary to provide the
          Service under reasonable confidentiality terms.
        </li>
        <li>We may also share certain information such as cookie data with third-party advertising partners. This
          information would allow third-party ad networks to, among other things, deliver targeted advertisements that
          they believe will be of most interest to you.
        </li>
        <li>We may remove parts of data that can identify you and share anonymized data with other parties. We may also
          combine your information with other information in a way that it is no longer associated with you and share
          that
          aggregated information.
        </li>
      </ul>

      <h4>Account Information</h4>
      <p>When you create an account on Waylens, you either fill out forms with requested information on the Waylens site
        or you authenticate yourself through a third-party service, like Facebook. When you authenticate through another
        site, you link that account with your Waylens account. Once the accounts are linked, we may collect and store
        personally identifying information that you have provided to that third party service, and consented to having
        shared with services like us. Also, we store the email address that you provided to create your Waylens Account
        and any information you fill out on the Waylens site. We do not receive or store passwords for linked
        accounts.</p>
      <p>When you link your Waylens account with a third party service account, we will get information about you from
        that third party service. That information could include, for example, biographical information or your
        geographic
        location, if you have provided that information to the third party service and made it available for Waylens to
        access. To the extent we obtain such information, we may store and use the information about you that we receive
        from third party services to improve and personalize Waylens Services. As a general practice, we strongly urge
        you
        to make careful judgments about any personal information you disclose to Internet services, including Waylens
        and
        any third party services you link to us.</p>

      <h4>Email Communications with Us</h4>
      <p>If you contact us, we may keep a record of that correspondence. We may also ask you to complete surveys that we
        use for research purposes, although you do not have to respond to them. We may also keep details of your visits
        to
        our site including, but not limited to, traffic data, location data, weblogs and other communication data, and
        the
        resources that you access.</p>
      <p>Occasionally, we might need to email you. We might need to send you some administrative information, tell you
        something important about your account or changes to our services, or update you on new policies. These
        administrative communications are considered part of Waylens Services and your Waylens account, which you may
        not
        be able to opt-out from receiving. Note that we will never email you to ask for your password or other Account
        information; if you receive such an email, contact us so we investigate and take any appropriate action.</p>

      <h4>Camera Diagnostic Information</h4>
      <p>When you connect your Waylens camera to the Internet, we may automatically receive certain information about
        your
        camera and your use of the camera, including log files, camera modes, settings, durations, error rates, and
        other
        usage information. We collect and use this information solely in anonymous and aggregate form, unless you have
        provided your consent to associate this information with your camera serial number. This information helps us to
        improve our products and services, troubleshoot bugs, and analyze camera errors.</p>
      <h4>Mobile Software Applications</h4>
      <p>When you use a Waylens mobile application we may automatically receive certain information about your mobile
        device and use of the application, including a device identifier, operating system, version, and other
        information
        about your mobile device as well as time spent in different portions of the Waylens mobile application. We
        monitor
        customer software usage to help us develop the design and layout of the mobile application and to improve the
        content to better match the interests of our Users. We may also collect different types of information about
        your
        location, including general information (e.g., IP address, zip code) and more specific information (e.g.,
        GPS-based functionality on mobile devices used to access the Services), and may use that information to
        customize
        the Services. If you access the Services through a mobile device and you do not want your device to provide us
        with location-tracking information, you can disable the GPS or other location-tracking functions on your device,
        provided your device allows you to do this. See your device manufacturer’s instructions for further details.</p>
      <h4>Information Related to Your Web Browser</h4>
      <p>We automatically receive and record information from your web browser when you interact with Waylens Services.
        This information may include your browser type and version, what sort of device you are using, your operating
        system and version, your language preference, the website or service that referred you to Waylens Services, the
        date and time of each web request you make, your screen display information, and information from any cookies we
        have placed on your web browser.</p>
      <h4>IP Address Information</h4>
      <p>We may collect information about your computer, including where available your IP address, operating system and
        browser type, for system administration, to fight spam, malware and identity theft, and to report aggregate
        information to our advertisers, if any. We also may use it to personalize Waylens Services for you and to
        generate aggregate, non-identifying information about how people use Waylens Services.</p>
      <h4>Information Collected Using Cookies</h4>
      <p>Like many websites, we use "cookie" technology to collect additional website usage data and to provide you with
        a
        good experience when you browse Waylens. This also allows us to improve our site.</p>
      <p>A cookie is a small data file that is transferred to your computer's hard disk. Waylens may use both session
        cookies and persistent cookies to better understand how you interact with our Services, to monitor aggregate
        usage
        by our Users and web traffic routing on our Services, and to customize and improve our Services. Our cookies do
        not, by themselves, contain information that personally identifies you. Most Internet browsers automatically
        accept cookies. You can instruct your browser, by changing its settings, to stop accepting cookies or to prompt
        you before accepting a cookie from the websites you visit. However, if you use your browser settings to block
        all
        cookies (including essential cookies) you may not be able to access all or parts of Waylens. Unless you have
        adjusted your browser setting so that it will refuse cookies, our system will issue cookies as soon you visit
        Waylens.</p>
      <h4>Information About Your Contacts</h4>
      <p>When you create your Waylens account, and authenticate via a third party service like Twitter, Waylens Services
        may collect, store, and periodically update the contact lists associated with that linked account, so that, for
        example, we can make it easy for you to connect with your existing contacts from that service who are also on
        Waylens.</p>

      <h4>Email Tracking</h4>
      <p>To measure the deliverability of our emails to Users, we may embed information, such as a web beacon or tag, in
        them.</p>
      <p>We never share information we receive from you unless:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>(a) we have your permission to share that information; or</li>
        <li>(b) we have given you prior notice that the information will be shared, and with whom; or</li>
        <li>(c) that information is aggregate information or other information that does not identify you.</li>
      </ul>
      <h4>Information Disclosed Pursuant to Business Transfers</h4>
      <p>We may buy or sell business assets. In these transactions, User information is typically one of the transferred
        business assets. Likewise, if we, or substantially all of our assets, get acquired, or if we go out of business
        or
        enter bankruptcy, User information would be one of the assets that is transferred or acquired by a third party.
        You acknowledge that such transfers may occur, and that any acquirer of us or our assets may continue to use
        your
        personal information as set forth in this policy.</p>

      <h4>Information Disclosed for Our Protection and the Protection of Others</h4>
      <p>We try to protect you from having your privacy violated through abuse of the legal system, whether attempted by
        individuals, entities, or governments. It is our policy to insist upon jurisdiction and proper legal process for
        governmental information requests, and to contest claims we believe to be unwarranted by the law. At the same
        time, we also reserve the right to access, preserve, and disclose information as we reasonably believe is
        necessary, in our sole discretion, to (i) satisfy a valid law, regulation, legal process, governmental request,
        or
        governmental order, (ii) enforce this Privacy Policy and our Terms of Service, including investigation of
        potential violations hereof, (iii) detect, prevent, or otherwise address fraud, security or technical issues,
        including exchanging information with other companies and organizations for fraud protection and the prevention
        of
        spam and malware, (iv) respond to User support requests, or (v) protect the rights, property, health or safety
        of
        us, our Users, any third parties or the public in general.</p>
      <h4>Information We Share with Your Consent or at Your Request</h4>
      <p>If you ask us to release information that we have about your account, we will do so if reasonable and not
        unduly
        burdensome.</p>
      <h4>Our Policy Towards Children</h4>
      <p>Waylens is not intended for children under 13 years of age. No one under 13 years of age may provide any
        personal
        information to or on Waylens. We do not knowingly collect personal information from children under 13. If you
        are
        under 13, do not use or provide any information on Waylens or on or through any of its features or register on
        the
        Waylens, or use any of the interactive or public comment features of Waylens or provide any information about
        yourself to us, including your name, address, telephone number, e-mail address or any screen name or User name
        you
        may use. If you become aware that your child has provided us with personal information without your consent,
        please contact us at <a href="mailto:privacy@waylens.com">privacy@waylens.com</a>.&nbsp; We do not knowingly collect personal information from children
        under 13. If we become aware that a child under 13 has provided us with personal information without
        verification
        of parental consent, we will take steps to remove such information and terminate the child's account.</p>
      <h4>Where We Store Your Personal Data</h4>
      <ul>
        <li>Your information collected through the Service may be stored and processed in the United States or any other
          country in which Waylens, its Affiliates or Agents maintain facilities.
        </li>
        <li>Waylens, its Affiliates, or Agents may transfer information that we collect about you, including personal
          information across borders and from your country or jurisdiction to other countries or jurisdictions around
          the
          world. If you are located in the European Union or other regions with laws governing data collection and use
          that may differ from U.S. law, please note that we may transfer information, including personal information,
          to
          a country and jurisdiction that does not have the same data protection laws as your jurisdiction.
        </li>
        <li>By registering for and using the Service you consent to the transfer of information to the U.S. or to any
          other country in which Waylens, its Affiliates or Agents maintain facilities and the use and disclosure of
          information about you as described in this Privacy Policy.
        </li>
        <li>We use commercially reasonable safeguards to help keep the information collected through the Service secure
          and take reasonable steps (such as requesting a unique password) to verify your identity before granting you
          access to your account. However, Waylens cannot ensure the security of any information you transmit to Waylens
          or guarantee that information on the Service may not be accessed, disclosed, altered, or destroyed.
        </li>
        <li>Please do your part to help us. You are responsible for maintaining the secrecy of your unique password and
          account information, and for controlling access to emails between you and Waylens, at all times. Your privacy
          settings may also be affected by changes the social media services you connect to Waylens make to their
          services. We are not responsible for the functionality, privacy, or security measures of any other
          organization.
        </li>
      </ul>

      <h4>The Security of Your Information</h4>
      <p>We have implemented measures designed to secure your personal information from accidental loss and from
        unauthorized access, use, alteration and disclosure. All information you provide to us is stored on our secure
        servers behind firewalls. We cannot, however, guarantee the security of any information. Unauthorized entry or
        use, hardware or software failure, and other factors may compromise the security of User information at any

        It’s important for you to prevent unauthorized access to your account and personal information by choosing and
